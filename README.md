# personal-website-v2

## Introduction

This is Amadeus Kang's personal website. Mainly, it serves as a portfolio for recruiters.

I use React because I intend to create a simple one-page web-application with the ability to add dynamic content later. If I was making a static web page, I would use Jekyll. I also use Typescript for the sake of learning it.

Feel free to fork it. In fact, I encourage it.

## Hosting and deployment
The website is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). I use a custom domain from [Squarespace Domains](https://domains.squarespace.com/).

## Documentation
[Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) <br />
[Deploying a React App (create-react-app) to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) <br />

## Running commands
I use [Git Bash](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_git-bash-on-windows) integrated in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to run commands. I use [npm] for the package manager.

You can preview the website by locally hosting it on your machine:
```npm start```

Build and deploy the website:
```npm run deploy```

And as always, you can stage changes, commit, and push the main branch like this:
```
git add .
git commit -m "updated"
git push origin main
```

## Packages, libraries, and other tools
`gh-pages` - Publish files to a gh-pages branch. <br />
`react-icons` - Icons made to be used as React componnets. <br />
